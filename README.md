Exploratory analysis of macro level socio economic conditions among Norwegian kommunes

I would like to do an exploratory analysis on socio economic conditions in Norway across various municipalities. Some of the interesting questions I would like to raise and attempt to find answers to are : 
1.	Why some municipalities operate profitably and few do not?
2.	Does the immigrant population adds strength to local economy of municipalities?
3.	Does education level play a role?
4.	How does crime rate distribute across municipalities? Are there any links to education, income and immigration?
5.	Based on our findings could we recommend a municipality or a region to someone immigrating to Norway?
6.	If I were to move to Norway, which commune or locality would I choose?

This project and the report attempts to provide better understanding of socio economic conditions in Norway, based on realistic figures. It is targeted for people who wants to know more about Norway or to those living in Norway to know more about the municipalities they live in.
